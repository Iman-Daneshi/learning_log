Alien Invasion is a game written based on Python Crash Course. While coding the game, I got familiar with the Pygame platform and some of its features. 
The game is about a ship shooting down aliens' ships. Players' kills, scores, and high scores are displayed while playing. In this project, I tried to go 
beyond the book's aims. For example, I let the user choose the game difficulty at the beginning. Then, based on the choice, aliens' kills and scores would 
be different.
