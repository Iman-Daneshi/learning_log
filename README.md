# learning_log
It is a website programmed by the Django framework. A user can register and log in to the website, choose or add 
a topic and leave some posts about learning that topic. After finishing the project, I learned about the Django 
concepts such as MVT, ORM, Templates, and Forms. Besides, I added Bootstrap4 to my project and used it to format 
pages. In the end, I deployed the site successfully in Heroku.
